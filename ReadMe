Gomoku – Java Console Game (with AI, SQLite Persistence, Logging, Tests & JavaDoc)
1. Overview

This project is a complete implementation of the game Gomoku (Five in a Row) written in Java.
The game runs in the console, includes a computer player (AI), persists every move using SQLite, and includes JUnit tests, JavaDoc, and proper design patterns as required by the assignment.

The human player uses X, and the computer player uses O.

2. Features
✔ Interactive console gameplay

Human plays by entering row/column

AI makes automatic moves

Game ends on win or draw

✔ AI opponent (Strategy Pattern)

AI is implemented via an AI interface

RandomAI is the default implementation

New AI types can be added without changing GomokuGame

✔ SQLite database persistence

Move history and game results are saved automatically into gomoku.db:

Player (Human or Computer)

Row and column

Symbol (X or O)

End-game result (Human Wins, Computer Wins, Draw)

✔ Singleton database controller

DatabaseManager uses the Singleton pattern to ensure only one DB handler exists.

✔ Logging

All moves are logged using GameLogger.

✔ JUnit tests

Covers:

Board logic

Win checking

Move placement

DatabaseManager (with test subclass)

AI move validity

✔ JavaDoc

Full JavaDoc is generated into:
target/site/apidocs/index.html

4. How to Run the Game
Using IntelliJ (recommended)

Open the project in IntelliJ

Run:
src/main/java/com/jenny/gomoku/game/Main.java

Play by typing moves like:

2 3
5 7
0 0

5. How to Run JavaDoc (IntelliJ Maven)

In IntelliJ:

Open the Maven panel

Navigate to:
Plugins → javadoc → javadoc

After it builds successfully, open:

target/site/apidocs/index.html

6. How to Run Tests

In IntelliJ:

Maven → Lifecycle → test

or right-click the test folder → Run Tests

7. Design Patterns Used
Strategy Pattern

Used for AI implementation:

AI interface

RandomAI implements the strategy

Allows plugging in smarter AIs later without changing game logic.

Singleton Pattern

Used for database persistence:

DatabaseManager

Single instance accessed via getInstance()

Guarantees only one DB connection handler exists.

8. Database Schema

SQLite file: gomoku.db

Table created automatically:

games (
  id      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  player  TEXT,
  row     INTEGER,
  col     INTEGER,
  symbol  TEXT
)


Each move is stored via:

saveMove(player, row, col, symbol)


Game results stored via:

saveResult("Human Wins")

9. How to Clean the Database (Optional)

In code/tests:

DatabaseManager.getInstance().clearDatabase();
